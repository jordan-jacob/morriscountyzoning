# morriscountyzoning
This is an R program that makes a single combined zoning map from Morris County GIS's collected zoning data.
As useful as the original zoning data is, it's pretty hard to read - single family housing, for example, might be R-1, or R-40.
For this program I manually went in and assigned these zones. If you just want this file, download the SortedZoning.geojson file.
If you want to run the program yourself/make modifications, download the R file and the UnsortedZoning.geojson file, and make sure 
to change the file locations (which are currently set to where they are on my computer)
